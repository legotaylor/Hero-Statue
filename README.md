# Hero Statue


## Known Bugs
- You may notice visual bugs when used with shaders.
  - Specifically, to prevent flickering (z-fighting) when using shaders, we offset the eyes ever more depending on the distance to the camera.
  - When not using shaders, this offset is static as it does not cause flickering.
  - If you use this mod alongside a shader mod that isn't Iris, you may notice flickering.
  - You can turn off this fix, or even the overlay in our client config.
